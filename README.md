# Context

This project aims to explore, retrieve, and analyse data from the Digital Laboratory of Ukraine, focusing on a select collection of approximately ten books related to epigraphy and cultural heritage. The primary objective is to gain insights into Ukraine’s epigraphic and cultural heritage through detailed data analysis, term extraction, and database management.
Objective

This project aims to deepen the knowledge of the architectural and epigraphic significance of the church, explore innovative techniques for digitizing and visualizing cultural heritage, and contribute to the preservation and accessibility of Armenian inscriptions in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Objectives and Main steps

    Data Retrieval: Collect and aggregate data from the Digital Laboratory of Ukraine, specifically targeting books and resources about epigraphy and cultural heritage.
    Data Cleaning and Formatting: Implement data preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality. This includes removing irrelevant or corrupt data, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
    Database Setup: Design and implement a database to store and manage retrieved data efficiently. The database should allow easy access and manipulation of the data for analysis.
    Term Extraction and Analysis: Employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key terms, concepts, and thematic elements from the texts. This will help us understand the predominant themes and patterns in Ukrainian epigraphy and cultural heritage.

# Requirements

    Proficiency in Python, knowledge of NLP techniques.

# Significance

This project will contribute to the understanding of Ukraine’s rich cultural heritage. It will provide valuable digital resources for future academic and cultural research in this field.
